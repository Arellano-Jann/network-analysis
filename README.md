# network-analysis

This assignment shows multiple multi-class classification methods using the network traffic data.

This is done in a few ways:

**Direct Multi-Class Classification [KNN, DT, NN, RF]**

Directly use our previous methods for binary classification (Decision Trees, KNN, Perceptron, Neural Networks) to predict multiple classes.

**Direct Multi-Class Classification with Resampling**

Resample the large, unbalanced dataset to have a smaller and more balanced dataset for classifier

**Hierarchical Multi-Class Classification**

Perform binary classification first (benign vs. malicious). Once a sample has been identified as malicious, perform multi-class classification to identify what kind of malicious activity is occurring.


To run this project, you’ll need to install all
the necessary packages (numpy, pandas, scikit learn, etc.).
Afterwards, you can run the makefile or the main file. 

## Helpers.py

`load_data(fname)`
- Input: This function should take a filename 
- Details: Loads the data in the file into a Pandas Dataframe.
- Output: The Dataframe should be returned from the function.

`clean_data(df)`
- Input: This function should take a Pandas Dataframe 
- Details: Replace all NaN/Inf values with 0. This function should also remove any columns of the data that are not numerical features.
- Output: This function will return a cleaned Dataframe.

`split_data(df)`
- Input: This function should take a Pandas Dataframe
- Details: split the Dataframe into training and testing data. This function should split the data into 80% for training and 20% for testing. This function splits it how the train_test_split function does which is randomly.
- Output: This function will return four Dataframes: X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test.



## multiclass_classification.py
### Direct Multi-Class Classification
Directly use our previous methods for multi-class classification (including Decision Trees and
KNN) to predict multiple classes.

`direct_multiclass_train(model_name, X_train, y_train)`
- Input: This function should take the model_name (“dt”, “knn”, “mlp”, “rf’) as input along with the training data (two Dataframes) 
- Details: Trains a model according to the model_name inputted.
- Output: return a trained model.

`direct_multiclass_test(model, X_test, y_test)`
- Input: This function should take a trained model 
- Details: evaluate the model on the test data,
- Output: returning an accuracy value.

### Direct Multi-Class Classification with Resampling
Perform data resampling to handle the unbalanced data distribution, and then conduct multi-class classification using MLP and random forest

`data_resampling(df, sampling_strategy)`
- Input: This function should take the dataframe as input, undersample it using sampling_strategy
- Details: Perform data resampling to handle the unbalanced data distribution, and then conduct multi-class classification using MLP and random forest.
- Output: return the resampled df.

### Hierarchical Multi-Class Classification Functions
Perform binary classification first (benign vs. malicious) using MLP. Once a sample has been
identified as malicious, perform multi-class classification to identify what kind of malicious
activity is occurring using random forest.

`improved_data_split(df)`
- Input: This function will take the original data df 
- Details: Transforms the df into train and test sets that both contain all the categories. 
- Output: Return train and test dataframes: df_train, and df_test.

`get_binary_dataset(df)`
- Input: This function will take a df 
- Details: Transfom df into a binary dataset
- Output: Returns the binary df
